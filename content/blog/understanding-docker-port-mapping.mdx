## üîç Overview

This guide explains how port configurations work in a Dockerised Next.js project. You'll understand the relationship between:

- The port defined in `package.json`
- The internal port exposed via the `Dockerfile`
- The host-to-container mapping in `docker-compose`

Getting these right ensures smooth development and debugging experiences.

## ‚úÖ Key Components and Their Roles

| Component        | Example                         | Role                                           | Must Match?           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `package.json`   | `"start": "next start -p 3001"` | Defines internal port Next.js listens to       | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| `Dockerfile`     | `EXPOSE 3001`                   | Declares internal port for documentation/tools | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended only   |
| `docker-compose` | `ports: ["4001:3001"]`          | Maps host (4001) ‚Üí container (3001)            | ‚ùå No ‚Äî host flexible |

---

## üß† How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Next.js starts inside the container**

```json
"start": "next start -p 3001"
```

This defines the internal port your app binds to.

2. Dockerfile declares EXPOSE 3001
   `EXPOSE 3001`
   This is only for documentation/tooling purposes. It does not affect the app‚Äôs behaviour.
3. docker-compose maps host to container

```yaml
ports:
  - "4001:3001"
```

Requests to `http://localhost:4001` on the host are forwarded to port 3001 inside the container.

## Example Scenario

package.json

```json
"start": "next start -p 3001"
```

Dockerfile

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 3001
```

ocker-compose.dev.yaml

```yaml
ports:
  - "4001:3001"
```

### Behaviour

| Access Point     | What It Does                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `localhost:4001` | Entry point on host            |
| `container:3001` | Where app is actually running  |
| ‚Üí Result         | Docker forwards ‚Üí App responds |

---

## üìå Note on `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT`

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT` is **for frontend/browser use only**.
- It does **not** affect backend/server port binding.
- Always use `-p` flag in `next start` to control server port.

---

## üß™ Common Pitfall

| Configuration                               | Result                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `next start -p 3002` + `ports: "4001:3001"` | ‚ùå Mismatch ‚Äî Browser fails |
| `next start -p 3002` + `ports: "4001:3002"` | ‚úÖ Works                    |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Best Practices

- Use a consistent internal port across the stack:

```json
"start": "next start -p 3001"
```

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3001
```

```yaml
ports:
  - "${HOST_PORT:-4001}:3001"
```

- Inject `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT=${HOST_PORT}` into `.env` to let your frontend build dynamic URLs correctly.

---

## üßæ Conclusion

- `next start -p xxx`: Defines app's internal port
- `EXPOSE xxx`: Optional for documentation/tooling
- `docker-compose ports`: Maps host ‚Üî container
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT`: Only for frontend use

With this knowledge, you'll avoid misconfigurations and ensure consistent behaviour across environments.
