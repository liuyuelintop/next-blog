## Problem Description

While learning unit testing, I followed a tutorial that configured Jest to run in `watch` mode within VSCode. This caused the **terminal to automatically open and run Jest every time I opened my project**, which was quite annoying. I was unsure how to resolve this issue but have finally found a solution.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Open VSCode Settings

1. Launch VSCode.
2. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner and select "Settings".
3. Alternatively, use the shortcut `Cmd + ,` (Mac) to open the settings.

### 2. Search for Jest Settings

1. In the settings search bar, type `jest`.
2. Find the settings related to the Jest plugin.

### 3. Modify Jest `runMode` Setting

1. Locate the `Jest: Run Mode` setting in the search results.
2. From the dropdown menu, select `on-demand` (or choose another mode such as `watch` or `on-save` as needed).

### 4. Directly Edit `settings.json`

1. In the settings page, click on the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top right corner or search for `settings.json` and open it.
2. Add or modify the following configuration in the `settings.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "jest.runMode": "on-demand" // Options: "on-demand", "watch", "on-save"
   }
   ```

3. Save and close the `settings.json` file.

### 5. Check Project Configuration File

1. Open the `.vscode/settings.json` file in the root directory of your project (if it exists).
2. Add or modify the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "jest.runMode": "on-demand" // Options: "on-demand", "watch", "on-save"
   }
   ```

3. Save and close the `settings.json` file.

## Additional Suggestions

- If the changes do not take effect immediately, try restarting VSCode.
- Check if there are other plugins or configuration files that might be overriding these settings.
- Ensure there are no conflicting settings in both the project and global configuration files.

By following these steps, I successfully resolved the issue of VSCode automatically opening Jest in the terminal. I hope these steps are helpful to you. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
