## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide on resolving the Stripe webhook signature verification error that occurred in a Next.js project deployed on Vercel, using Caddy for reverse proxy. The error was due to an extra newline character in the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable. By following this guide, you can troubleshoot similar issues and ensure smooth operation of your Stripe webhooks.

## Problem Description

The application encountered an error with Stripe webhook integration where the signature verification was failing. The specific error message indicated:

```
Webhook Error: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload. Are you passing the raw request body you received from Stripe? If a webhook request is being forwarded by a third-party tool, ensure that the exact request body, including JSON formatting and new line style, is preserved.
Note: The provided signing secret contains whitespace. This often indicates an extra newline or space is in the value.
```

## Root Cause

Upon investigation, it was discovered that the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel had an extra newline character at the end. This extra character caused the signature verification to fail as it did not match the expected signature format.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identify the Extra Character

1. **Check Environment Variable**: Inspect the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel's dashboard.
2. **Remove Whitespace**: Ensure that there are no extra spaces or newline characters at the end of the secret.

### Step 2: Update Environment Variable in Vercel

1. **Navigate to Environment Variables**:

   - Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
   - Scroll down to "Environment Variables".

2. **Edit the Variable**:
   - Locate the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable.
   - Remove any extra whitespace or newline characters.
   - Save the changes.

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. **Restart Services**:
   - After updating the environment variable, redeploy your application to apply the changes.

## Conclusion

By ensuring the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` does not contain any extra whitespace or newline characters and properly handling the raw request body, the Stripe webhook signature verification error was resolved. This guide provides a detailed approach to identifying and fixing such issues, ensuring reliable and secure webhook integration.
