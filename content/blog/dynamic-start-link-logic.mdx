## 🔗 Purpose

In containerised development environments, it's easy to lose track of what port an app is running on — especially when host-to-container port mappings differ.

To solve this, we introduce a simple pattern that **dynamically prints the correct app link (e.g. `http://localhost:4001`) when the server starts**, based on the current environment variable (e.g. `HOST_PORT`).

This reduces guesswork and ensures developers always know exactly where to access the application — whether it's running locally or inside Docker.

---

## ⚙️ High-Level Approach

1. **Keep the app startup script clean and reusable**

   Define your actual server start command in a dedicated script (e.g. `start-server.sh`):

   ```bash
   next start -p 3001
   ```

   This script contains no logging or environment logic and can be reused in CI, production, or other automation.

2. **Add a dynamic wrapper**

   Create a wrapper script (e.g. `start.ts` or `start.js`) that:

   - Spawns the actual start script
   - Waits for the server "ready" signal
   - Detects the port from the environment (e.g. `HOST_PORT`)
   - Prints the resolved URL like:

   ```
   App ready — visit: http://localhost:4001
   ```

---

## ✅ Why This Matters

- 🧭 **Instant feedback**: Clear startup logs help devs find the running app without searching Docker configs or port mappings.
- 💻 **Portable setup**: Works the same in Docker, local dev, or cloud shell environments.
- 🔄 **DRY principle**: Keeps logic clean and reusable across environments.
- 🧪 **CI/CD friendly**: Start logic remains testable and scriptable.

## 🧪 Example Output

**In Docker:**

```
> App starting...
> App ready — visit: http://localhost:4001
```

**Locally:**

```
> App ready — visit: http://localhost:3001
```

## 🗂️ Suggested File Structure

```
scripts/
├── start-server.sh      # Minimal entry point (no logs, no logic)
└── start.js or start.ts # Dynamic wrapper (prints resolved URL)
.env                     # Defines HOST_PORT or fallback
package.json
```

---

## ✨ Tip

Inject `HOST_PORT` into your environment via Docker or shell:

```bash
HOST_PORT=4001 node scripts/start.js
```

This makes it easy to reuse across local and containerised setups.

## 🧾 Summary

This simple pattern helps teams:

- Remove confusion around Docker port mapping
- Improve developer onboarding and DX
- Maintain clean separation of concerns between start logic and messaging

Feel free to adapt it to your own stack — whether you're using Node.js, Python, or any web server.
