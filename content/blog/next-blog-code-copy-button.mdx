# Implementing a One-Click Copy Button for MDX Code Blocks

This document describes how to add a one-click copy button to code blocks in an MDX technical documentation blog built with Next.js.

## Background

In many blogs, code blocks are typically wrapped with triple backticks and rendered as `<pre><code>` elements. To enhance user experience, we aim to place a copy button at the top-right corner of each code block, enabling users to copy the code with a single click.

## Initial Approach

Initially, we used a `useEffect` hook (or custom hook) on the client side to scan all `<pre>` elements and dynamically inject the copy button. This required minimal changes to the existing code structure.

## Improved Approach: Using `<figure>` as the Positioning Container

When using tools like `rehype-pretty-code`, code blocks are often wrapped in a `<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure>` element. Instead of inserting the copy button directly into `<pre>`, we can place it inside `<figure>`. This avoids potential layout issues such as scrollbars or overflow on `<pre>`.

1. **Target `<figure>` Instead of `<pre>`**  
   Search for:

   ```tsx
   const figures = rootElement.querySelectorAll(
     "figure[data-rehype-pretty-code-figure]"
   );
   ```

   and append the button to the `<figure>` element rather than the `<pre>` element.

2. **Set `<figure>` to `position: relative;`**  
   In your global CSS (e.g., `globals.css`), add:

   ```css
   figure[data-rehype-pretty-code-figure] {
     position: relative;
   }
   ```

   This ensures that the button, with absolute positioning, will be positioned relative to the `<figure>`.

3. **Define a `.copy-button` Class with Tailwind's `@apply`**  
   To avoid issues with Tailwind Purge, define the button styles in your global CSS:
   ```css
   .copy-button {
     @apply absolute top-2 right-2 bg-gray-700 text-white rounded px-2 py-1 text-sm opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition;
   }
   ```
   Then, in your JavaScript/TypeScript code, simply add the class to the button:
   ```ts
   button.classList.add("copy-button");
   ```

## Handling Style Conflicts

If other plugins or global styles interfere with the buttonâ€™s positioning:

- Use browser DevTools to ensure that the `<figure>` element has `position: relative;` and that the button receives the correct computed styles (e.g., `position: absolute; top: 0.5rem; right: 0.5rem;`).
- Adjust the styles on the `<pre>` element if necessary. For example:
  ```css
  figure[data-rehype-pretty-code-figure] pre {
    overflow: auto;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 1rem;
  }
  ```
- Verify that the Tailwind classes are not purged by using the defined `.copy-button` class with `@apply`.

## Conclusion

By injecting the copy button into the `<figure>` element and ensuring it has a proper positioning context and dedicated styling, we can achieve a clean, one-click copy solution for MDX code blocks. This approach aligns with modern React and Next.js best practices, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
