# Implementing a One-Click Copy Button for MDX Code Blocks

This document describes how to add a one-click copy button to code blocks in an MDX technical documentation blog.

## Background

In many blogs, code blocks are typically wrapped with triple backticks and rendered as `<pre><code>` elements. To enhance user experience, we aim to place a copy button at the top-right corner of each code block, enabling users to copy the code with a single click.

## Implementation Process

1. **Minimal Change Approach**  
   Initially, we used a `useEffect` hook on the client side to scan all `<pre>` elements and dynamically inject the copy button. This required minimal changes to the existing code structure.

2. **Encapsulation into a Custom Hook**  
   To maintain a clean and reusable code structure, we encapsulated the button injection logic into a custom hook (`useInjectCopyButtons`) and invoked it within the MDX rendering component. This approach kept the main codebase concise and maintainable.

3. **Detail Optimization**
   - Ensure the copy action executes after the DOM is mounted.
   - Add a "Copied!" feedback message to improve user experience.
   - Address dynamic Tailwind CSS class injection to ensure proper styling of the button.

## Conclusion

With this implementation, we successfully added a one-click copy feature to the code blocks in our MDX documents while maintaining modular and clean components. This approach aligns with modern best practices in React and Next.js, laying a solid foundation for future enhancements.
