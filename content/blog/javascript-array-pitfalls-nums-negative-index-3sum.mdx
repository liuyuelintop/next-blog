When solving algorithm problems like **3Sum**, we often focus on pointer movement and duplicate handling. But in JavaScript, subtle quirks in how arrays behave as objects can trip you up. Let's walk through a real debugging journey that exposes these hidden pitfalls.

## The Complete 3Sum Solution

Here's a typical 3Sum implementation that demonstrates the behavior we'll explore:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var threeSum = function(nums) {
  const res = [];
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
    if (nums[i] > 0) break;

    let l = i + 1, r = nums.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
      const sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
      if (sum > 0) r--;
      else if (sum < 0) l++;
      else {
        res.push([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]]);
        while (l < r && nums[l] === nums[l + 1]) l++;
        while (l < r && nums[r] === nums[r - 1]) r--;
        l++; r--;
      }
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```

## The Dangerous-Looking Duplicate Check

Notice this line in the solution above:

```js
if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
```

But what if we wrote it like this instead?

```js
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  if (nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue; // skip duplicates
  // ... rest of algorithm
}
```

At first glance, this looks dangerous:

- When `i === 0`, we access `nums[-1]`
- In many languages, this would throw an array bounds error

But in **JavaScript**, it's actually fine. Why? Because `nums[-1]` doesn't throw—it evaluates to `undefined`. So `nums[0] === nums[-1]` becomes `1 === undefined`, which is `false`. The loop continues without issue.

Still, the **clearer, conventional way** is:

```js
if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
```

This makes the intent obvious: "skip duplicates after the first element."

## Arrays Are Special Objects

Why does `nums[-1]` not blow up? Because arrays in JavaScript are just **objects with special handling for non-negative integer keys**.

Under the hood:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

is roughly equivalent to:

```js
{
  "0": 1,
  "1": 2,
  "2": 3,
  "3": 4,
  length: 4,
  __proto__: Array.prototype
}
```

So when you write `nums[-1]`, JavaScript simply looks for the property with key `"-1"`. It doesn't exist → returns `undefined`. No runtime error.

This behavior is quite different from other array-related pitfalls you might encounter. For more on JavaScript array initialization issues, see our guide on [common array pitfalls](/blog/javascript-array-initialization-pitfalls).

## Assigning to Negative Indices

You can even do this:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
nums[-1] = 0;

console.log(nums); // [1, 2, 3, 4, -1: 0]
console.log(nums[-1]); // 0
console.log(nums.length); // 4 (unchanged)
```

Here `"-1"` becomes a **normal object property**, not an array index. That's why array methods (`map`, `forEach`, `push`) ignore it—they only operate on valid array indices.

## Dot vs Bracket Notation

Why can't we do `nums.-1`? Because in JavaScript, dot notation only works with **valid identifiers**.

- ✅ Valid: `user.name`, `user.first_name`, `user.$dollar`, `user.var123`
- ❌ Invalid: `user.123`, `user.-1`, `user.foo-bar`, `user.for`

So:

```js
nums[-1]    // ✅ works, equivalent to nums["-1"]
nums["-1"]  // ✅ works
nums.-1     // ❌ SyntaxError
```

If the property name isn't a valid identifier, you must use **bracket notation**.

## Serialization and Hidden Properties

"Fake" keys like `"-1"` or `"foo"` don't appear in JSON:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums[-1] = 99;
nums.foo = "bar";

console.log(JSON.stringify(nums)); // "[1,2,3]"
console.log(Object.keys(nums)); // ["0","1","2","-1","foo"]
```

These properties live on the array object, but they're invisible to normal array behavior and serialization.

## Key Takeaways for Algorithm Problems

1. **`nums[-1]` is not the last element**—it's just a string property lookup that returns `undefined` if not set. Safe to use in `if (nums[i] === nums[i-1])`, but clearer with an explicit `i > 0` check.

2. **Arrays are objects**. Non-negative integers are treated as real indices; everything else is just a property.

3. **Dot notation only works with valid identifiers**. Use bracket notation otherwise.

4. **For the last element**, use:
   ```js
   nums[nums.length - 1]; // classic
   nums.at(-1); // modern ES2022+
   ```

5. **When debugging algorithm problems**, remember: JavaScript array behavior can be subtly different from languages like Python or Java.

The 3Sum skip-duplicate trick exposed a deeper truth—arrays in JavaScript are just objects. Once you understand that, you'll avoid nasty surprises in both algorithms and production code.
