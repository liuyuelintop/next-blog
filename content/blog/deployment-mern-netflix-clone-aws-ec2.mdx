# Deployment of MERN Netflix-Clone Application on AWS EC2

## Overview

This document outlines the process of deploying a MERN stack application, specifically a Netflix-Clone, on an AWS EC2 instance. The deployment process includes setting up the server environment, configuring the database, managing environment variables, and securing the application using HTTPS. The deployment was guided by various tutorials and resources to ensure a smooth and secure setup.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Provisioning AWS EC2 Instance**

- **Instance Type**: Chose a t2.micro instance (free tier eligible).
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was used for its stability and support.
- **Security Group**: Configured inbound rules to allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) access.

### 2. **Server Setup**

- **Create SSH Key**
- **SSH Access**: Connected to the EC2 instance using SSH.
- **Environment Setup**:
  - Installed Node.js (Install MongoDB if you need. I use Mongo Altas )
- **Code Deployment**: Rsync Code from your device

### 3. **App Setup**

- Created a `.env` file to manage sensitive information such as database URIs and API keys.
- Installed dependencies using `npm run build`.
  - `"build" : "npm install && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend"`

### 4. **SystemD Setup**

- **Create the Enviroenment file**
- **Create the systemd Service file**

### 5. **Security and HTTPS Configuration**

- **Caddy as Web Server**: Used Caddy to handle HTTPS redirection and SSL certificate management.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Caddy automatically obtained and renewed SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.
- **Configuration**:
  - Redirected all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
  - Ensured secure cookie transmission by setting the `Secure` flag to `true`.

### 6. **CI/CD Pipeline** (optional)

- Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- Configured workflows to automatically deploy updates to the EC2 instance upon commits to the main branch.

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

### Issue: Secure Cookie Transmission

**Problem**: The application was unable to transmit cookies when `Secure` was set to `true` due to the lack of HTTPS.
**Solution**: Implemented Caddy to handle HTTPS, and updated cookie settings to use `Secure: true` once HTTPS was enabled.

## Conclusion

The deployment of the MERN Netflix-Clone application on AWS EC2 was successfully completed by setting up a secure and scalable environment. The use of Caddy for automatic HTTPS ensured secure data transmission. This deployment setup serves as a fundamental solution for production environments, ensuring security and efficiency.
