## Content Standards

When working with blog content:

### Tagging Guidelines
- **Maximum 4 tags per post**
- **Use only tags from** `/lib/content/tags.json`
- **Priority order:** Language → Primary Concept → Secondary Concept/Tool → Industry Context
- **Validation rules:** See `/lib/content/validation-rules.json`
- **Full guidelines:** Reference `/lib/content/standards.md`

### Tag Selection Process
1. Primary language (if language-specific content >50%)
2. Main concept (required - what readers will learn)
3. Secondary concept OR primary tool (if significant >20% content)
4. Industry context (purpose/audience)

### Quick Examples

- Framework tutorial: `["JavaScript", "React", "API", "Tutorial"]`
- Performance guide: `["React", "Performance", "Best Practices"]`
