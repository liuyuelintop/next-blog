## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Production Error Boundary Crashes** - Resolved fatal blog rendering failures that caused entire pages to crash in production
  - **Root Cause**: MDX component used `new Function(code)` constructor without error handling, causing crashes in production environments with strict CSP policies
  - **Secondary Issue**: QueryPagination client component caused server/client hydration mismatches in production builds
  - **Impact**: Blog posts (especially `/blog/four-sum-algorithm-one-character-bug`) and blog index page would show error boundaries instead of content

    - Added try-catch blocks around MDX compilation with user-friendly error messages
    - Converted QueryPagination to server-side compatible implementation  
    - Added post data validation to prevent undefined errors
