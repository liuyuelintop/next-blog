## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive debugging protocols for production error resolution

### Changed
- Enhanced documentation structure with technical deep-dive analysis

---

## [2.4.0] - 2025-08-30

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Production Error Boundary Crashes** - Resolved fatal blog rendering failures that caused entire pages to crash in production

    - Added try-catch blocks around MDX compilation with user-friendly error messages
    - Converted QueryPagination to server-side compatible implementation  
    - Added post data validation to prevent undefined errors
    - Implemented graceful fallback UI for all rendering failures
  - **Testing**: Thoroughly validated in production-like environment with all major pages working correctly
  - **Prevention**: Added robust error boundaries and validation patterns for future MDX content

### Added
- Production error debugging protocol in CLAUDE.md
- Comprehensive root cause analysis in `/docs/PRODUCTION_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md`
